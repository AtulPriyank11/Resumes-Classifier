# Resumes-non-resumes-Classification
Trained a DenseNet121 model on a diverse dataset with resume and non-resume images. Employed data augmentation for robustness, evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, visualized using a confusion matrix for classification insights. Will work on improving the model.
Make sure the Resumes and Non-Resumes folder must be inside a main folder i.e. Dataset(Main Folder) and inside this folder, keep Resumes and Non-Resumes folder together. 
After working with actual dataset, I have also provided a unseen dataset of resume and non-resume. So, while evaluating test set, take unseen data as test set.
